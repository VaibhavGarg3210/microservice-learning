										We are using Annotation in class in this project 

	@RestController = we can use @Controller and in method we can use @ResponseBody it will work same.
	ResponseEntity<T> = Allow Developers to send responsebody, status, and headers on the Http response
	@ControllerAdvice -> Global Exception Logic
	@RestControllerAdvice -> Same as RestController.
	RequestEntity -> if we want request header and request body
	@ResquestHeader & @RequestBody it is used to receive the request body and header individually.
